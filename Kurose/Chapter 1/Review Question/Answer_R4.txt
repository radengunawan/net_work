### Definition of "Access Technology"

In computer networking, access technology refers to the various 
methods and technologies used to connect end-user devices 
(like computers, smartphones, or routers) to a broader network, such as 
the internet or a corporate network. 
This connection acts as the "last mile" or the final segment that links 
the user to the network infrastructure, such as a telecom provider's 
network.

Analogy

Imagine a vast highway system that connects different cities 
(representing the broader internet or a corporate network). 
**Access technology** is like the different types of roads, bridges, 
or tunnels that connect your home (the end-user device) to the nearest 
highway (the main network). Depending on where you live 
(your location) and whatâ€™s available, you might use different types 
of roads:

- Fiber-optic cable: Like a high-speed expressway directly 
from your home to the highway, allowing very fast travel.
- DSL (Digital Subscriber Line): Similar to a regular road 
with moderate speed limits, good for shorter distances.
- Cable modem: Like a wide, multi-lane road shared with others 
  in your neighborhood, offering decent speed but sometimes slowing 
  down if too many cars are on it.
- Wi-Fi: Comparable to a personal bridge connecting your house to 
  the main road, with flexibility in where you place it, 
  but sometimes with weaker structural integrity.

Example:

Consider the following quantitative comparison between different 
access technologies:

- Fiber-optic: Can provide speeds up to **1 Gbps (1000 Mbps)**. 
 This means you could download a 2-hour HD movie (~5 GB) in 
 approximately **40 seconds**.
  
- **DSL:** Typically offers speeds of **10-20 Mbps**. 
  The same 2-hour HD movie would take around **33-50 minutes** to 
  download.

- **Cable modem:** Usually provides speeds of **100-300 Mbps**. 
  Downloading the movie would take about **2-5 minutes**.

- **Wi-Fi (depending on the standard and distance):
  Could range from 54 Mbps (for older standards like 802.11g) 
  to 600 Mbps (for 802.11ac). The download time for the movie could 
  vary from **1.5 minutes** to **12 minutes**.

In summary, access technology is the method through which your device 
connects to the broader network, with different technologies offering 
varying speeds, reliability, and performance, much like different 
types of roads connect your home to a highway.

Here are 4 access technologies, classified according to their typical 
use case:

1. Fiber to the Home (FTTH)
   - Classification: Home Access
   - Description: A high-speed broadband connection using fiber-optic 
    cables that run directly to individual homes. 
	It offers very high bandwidth and is often used for residential 
	internet service.

2. Ethernet (Gigabit Ethernet)
   - Classification: Enterprise Access
   - Description: A wired network technology commonly used within 
    businesses and office environments to connect computers and 
	other devices to a local area network (LAN). 
	It provides reliable, high-speed connections typically ranging 
	from 1 Gbps to 10 Gbps.

3. 4G LTE
   - Classification: Wide-Area Wireless Access
   - Description: A wireless broadband technology used for mobile 
   internet access, allowing users to connect to the internet over 
   a wide area. 
   It's commonly used by smartphones and other mobile devices to 
   provide internet access on the go.

4. Wi-Fi (802.11ac)
   - Classification: Home Access / Enterprise Access
   - Description: A wireless networking technology commonly 
   used in both homes and enterprises to provide wireless internet 
   access within a localized area, such as a home, office, 
   or public space. 
   Wi-Fi networks are often connected to a broadband modem or a 
   corporate network.
