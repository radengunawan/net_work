In computer networking, the terms host 
and end system are often used interchangeably, 
but they can have slightly different connotations 
depending on the context. 

Host
A host is any device that can send or receive data 
over a network. This includes computers, servers, 
smartphones, IoT devices, etc. 
Essentially, if a device has an IP address and can 
communicate over a network, it's considered a host.

Analogy: Imagine a large postal system. A host would
 be any addressable location within this system, 
 like a house, a business, or a post office. 
 Each of these locations can send or receive mail 
 (data).

Example: In a small office network, there might be 
10 computers (hosts), each with its own IP address, 
capable of communicating with each other or with 
external servers.

End System
An end system is a specific type of host that is 
on the "edge" of the network and is the origin or 
destination of data. 
End systems typically include user-facing devices like 
personal computers, smartphones, or servers that provide 
services directly to users.

Analogy: Continuing with the postal system
 analogy, an end system would be the final 
 destination or the starting point of mail. 
 For example, a personal home address where someone sends 
 or receives letters (data). 
 The end system is where the mail (data) actually 
 originates or where it is ultimately 
 delivered.

Example: Consider a web browsing scenario:
- Your laptop (an end system) sends a request to a web 
server (another end system).
- The web server processes the request and sends the 
data back to your laptop.
- Both your laptop and the web server are end systems 
because they are the endpoints in this communication 
process.

 Key Differences
- Host is a broader term that includes any device 
with network capabilities.
- End system specifically refers to a host 
that is either the origin or destination of data on 
the network.

Example in a Network
Let's say there is a company network:
- Hosts: The network includes 50 desktop computers, 
             10 printers, 5 servers, and a few IoT devices 
             like smart thermostats.
			 
- End Systems: Out of these, the desktop computers 
					and servers are considered end systems 
					because they are where data is either 
					generated (e.g., a user sending 
					an email) or received (e.g., 
					a web server delivering a webpage). 
					The printers and IoT devices, while 
					they are hosts, are not typically 
					considered end systems in the context 
					of user data flow.

Summary:
While all end systems are hosts, 
not all hosts are end systems. 
The term "end system" is used to emphasize the 
role of a device as the final source or 
destination of network data, while "host" is a 
more general term encompassing all 
network-capable devices.

So, a web server is indeed an "end system" in the context 
of computer networking.

Explanation:
A web server serves as both the origin and the destination 
of data in a network communication process. 
When you request a webpage from a web server 
(e.g., by typing a URL in your browser), the server 
receives your request, processes it, and sends back 
the data (the webpage) to your device. 

Why is it an End System?
- Origin of Data: The web server is the source of 
the webpage data that it sends to the client's 
device (like your computer or smartphone).
- Destination of Data: The web server is also 
the destination for requests from clients 
when they ask for a webpage.

Example:
If you visit a website, such as `www.example.com`, your 
device (an end system) sends a request to the web server 
hosting that website (another end system). 
The web server processes this request and sends the
 webpage data back to your device. 
 Here, both your device and the web server are 
 end systems because they are the endpoints 
 of the communication process.


A host that is not an end system could be a network router
 or a network switch. 

Example: Network Router

A router is a device that forwards data packets between 
computer networks, directing the data to its destination. 
While a router has an IP address and is a host on the network, 
it is not considered an end system because it doesn't generate or 
consume data as part of typical user communication. 
Instead, it facilitates the transfer of data between end systems.

Analogy:
Imagine a mail sorting facility in a postal system. 
The facility itself doesn't generate or receive personal mail
 (like a home would), but it plays a critical role in directing mail
 to its final destination. 
 In this analogy, the sorting facility is like a router, 
 and the homes are the end systems.

 Example:
- In a home network, your router has an IP address and is 
responsible for routing traffic between your devices 
(like your computer, smartphone) and the internet.
- While your computer and smartphone are end systems because 
they generate or receive data (e.g., browsing the web, sending emails), 
the router is not an end system. 
It merely routes the data between your end systems and 
the web servers you're communicating with.

Summary:
The router is a host because it has an IP address and is capable 
of handling network traffic, but it is not an end system because 
it does not serve as the origin or final destination of user data 
in typical network communication. 
Instead, it facilitates the communication between end systems.
