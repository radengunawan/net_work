Transmission Rate of Ethernet LANs:
   - Ethernet LANs can have various transmission 
   rates depending on the Ethernet standard being used. 
   Common transmission rates include:
     - 10 Mbps (Megabits per second) for the 
		original Ethernet (10BASE-T).
     - 100 Mbps for Fast Ethernet (100BASE-T).
     - 1 Gbps (Gigabit per second) for Gigabit Ethernet (1000BASE-T).
     - 10 Gbps for 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GBASE-T).
     - 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps for more advanced Ethernet 
		standards like 40GBASE-T and 100GBASE-T.

R8: Physical Media that Ethernet Can Run Over:
   - Ethernet can run over various types of physical media, including:
     - Twisted Pair Copper Cables (e.g., 
		Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a, Cat7, and Cat8 cables).
     - Fiber Optic Cables (e.g., single-mode 
		fiber and multi-mode fiber).
     - Coaxial Cable (primarily used in early Ethernet 
		standards such as 10BASE2 and 10BASE5).
     - Wireless Media (used in wireless Ethernet, 
	 such as Wi-Fi, though it's technically not "Ethernet" in 
	 the traditional wired sense).

These rates and media types are used to define the capabilities and infrastructure of Ethernet LANs in various networking environments.
